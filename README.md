# SSL_Comparison# Semi-Supervised Learning on Bank Marketing Dataset

This project explores semi-supervised learning techniques applied to the imbalanced **Bank Marketing** dataset. It was developed as part of the **Machine Learning** course at the **University of Ottawa** (Winter 2024), and all code is provided in a Jupyter Notebook.

## 🧠 Project Summary
- Benchmarked semi-supervised learning models using **XGBoost** and **LightGBM**
- Improved accuracy from **76% to 88%** through confidence-based pseudo-labeling
- Applied resampling strategies to reduce class imbalance and skew across different label coverage scenarios
- Designed a reproducible evaluation pipeline for various labeled/unlabeled data ratios
- Evaluated performance using **F1 score**, **precision**, and **accuracy**

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- Python (Jupyter Notebook)
- NumPy, Pandas
- XGBoost
- Scikit-learn

## 📁 Notes
- All code and experiments are included in a single Jupyter notebook, and the report of results is provided as a seperate file.
- This project was submitted for the Machine Learning course final assignment.
